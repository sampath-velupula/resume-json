      "summary": "Academic conferences provide an ideal outlet for the presentation of numerous articles and research papers, often published in academic journals. Publications are generally provided in a standard format: Portable Document Format (PDF). While this format is useful because it offers consistency and a dependable method of information exchange, it lacks machine-friendly mechanisms for sorting, classifying, and searching information. To accomplish these necessary functions, conference data must first be enriched with metadata. The goal of this paper is to build a Conference Knowledge Management System where data can be parsed, manipulated, stored, queried, and accessed by users."
